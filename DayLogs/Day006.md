1. Matrix Plots  
  Matrix plots allow you to plot data as color-encoded matrices and can also be used to indicate clusters within the data
  
  * heatmap  
  In order for a heatmap to work properly, your data should already be in a matrix form, the sns.heatmap function basically just colors it in for you.

  * clustermap  
  The clustermap uses hierarchal clustering to produce a clustered version of the heatmap.

2. Grids  
  Grids are general types of plots that allow you to map plot types to rows and columns of a grid, this helps you create similar plots separated by features.

  * __PairGrid__ is a subplot grid for plotting pairwise relationships in a dataset.

  * __FacetGrid__ is the general way to create grids of plots based off of a feature

3. Regression Plots  
  * __lmplot__  
  lmplot allows you to display linear models, but it also conveniently allows you to split up those plots based off of features, as well as coloring the hue based off of features.

4. Style and Color
