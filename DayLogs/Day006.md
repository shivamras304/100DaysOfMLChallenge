1. Matrix Plots  
  Matrix plots allow you to plot data as color-encoded matrices and can also be used to indicate clusters within the data
  
  * heatmap  
  In order for a heatmap to work properly, your data should already be in a matrix form, the sns.heatmap function basically just colors it in for you.

  * clustermap  
  The clustermap uses hierarchal clustering to produce a clustered version of the heatmap.

2. Grids  
  Grids are general types of plots that allow you to map plot types to rows and columns of a grid, this helps you create similar plots separated by features.

  * __PairGrid__ is a subplot grid for plotting pairwise relationships in a dataset.

  * __FacetGrid__ is the general way to create grids of plots based off of a feature
