1. Principal Component Analysis
  * Unsupervised statistical technique used to examine the interrelations among a set of variables in order to identify the underlying structure of those variables.
  * Also known as general factor analysis
  * Where regression determines a line of best fit to a data set, factor analysis determines several orthogonal (at right angles) lines of best fit to the data set.
  * The lines are perpendicular to each other in n-dimensional space.
  * n-dimensional space is the variable sample space.
  * There are as many dimensions as there are variables, so in a data set with 4 variables the sample space is 4-dimensional.
  * Components are a linear transformation that chooses a variable system for the data set such that the greatest variance of the data set comes to lie on the first axis.
  * If we use PCA on a data set with large number of variables, we can compress the amount of explained variation to just a few components.
  * The most challenging part of PCA is interpreting the components.

  * PCA is just a transformation of the data and it attempts to find out what features explain the most variance in your data.
