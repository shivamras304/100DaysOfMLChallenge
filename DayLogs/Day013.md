1. Support Vector Machines
  * SVMs are supervised learning algorithms that analyse data and recognize patterns, used for classification and regression analysis.
  * SVMs are inherently binary classifier.
  * We would like to choose a hyperplane that maximizes the margin between classes.
  * The vector points that the margin lines touch are known as Support Vectors.
  * We can expand this idea to non-linearly separable data through the 'kernel trick'.
  * Through the use of 'kernel trick', we visualize this inseparable data in another Z dimension.
  * Grid Search: Grid search allows you to find the right parameters such as like what C or gamma values to use. The idea of creating a grid of parameters is trying out all the best possible combinations is called grid search.
  * Understand Bias Variance Tradeoff and also the params for GridSearchCV
