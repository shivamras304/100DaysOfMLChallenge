1. Natural Language Processing
  * Steps:
    * Compile Documents
    * Featurize them
    * Comapare their features
  * A document represented as a vector of word counts is called a "Bag of Words"
  * Use cosine similarity on the vectors to determine similarity
  * We can improve on Bag of Words by adjusting word counts based on their frequency in corpus (the group of all the documents)
  * We can use TF-IDF for this
  * Term Frequency: Importance of the term within that document
    * TF(d,t) = Number of occurences of term t in document d
  * Inverse Document Frequency - Importance of the term in the corpus
    * IDF(t) = log(D/t) where
      * D = total number of documents
      * t = number of documents with the term
  * TF-IDF = tf * log(N/df)
    * tf = frequency of x in y
    * df = number of documents containing x
    * N = total number of documents
