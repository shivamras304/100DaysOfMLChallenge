1. Recommender Systems
  * Two major types:
    * Collaborative filtering produces  recommendations based on the knowledge of users' attitude to items, that is it uses the "wisdom of the crowd" to recommend items.
    * Content based recommender systems focus on the attributes of the items and give you recommendations based on the similarity between them.

  * CF can be further divided into:
    * Memory based Collaborative Filtering (Cosine similarity)
    * Model based Collaborative Filtering (Singular Value Decomposition)

  * Correlation based on similarity of data
