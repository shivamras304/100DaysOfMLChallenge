1. K Means Clustering
  * Cluster and label unlabelled data
  * Unsupervised learning algorithm
  * Algorithm
    * Choose a number of Clusters 'K'
    * Randomly assign each point to a cluster
    * Until clusters stop changing, repeat the following:
      * For each cluster, compute the cluster centroidby taking mean value of points in the cluster
      * Assign each point to the cluster for which the centroid is the closest
    * Determining best value of K: Elbow method:
      * Compute SSE for some values of K
      * SSE is the sum of squared distances between all the members of the cluster and its centroid
      * Plot K against SSE
      * Error decreases as K gets larger
      * Choose K at which SSE decreases abrubptly (an elbow)
  * make_blobs: to make fake dataset
