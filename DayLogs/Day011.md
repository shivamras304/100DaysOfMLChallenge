1. Logistic Regression
  * Cleaning the data
  * __Imputation__ is the process of replacing missing data with substituted values.
  * We'll need to convert categorical features to dummy variables using pandas! Otherwise our machine learning algorithm won't be able to directly take in those features as inputs
  * pd.get_dummies()
  * Multi-collinearity: Bad for ML algorithms when a bunch of columns are perfect predictors for another column.
