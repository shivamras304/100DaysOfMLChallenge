1. Logistic Regression
  * Cleaning the data
  * __Imputation__ is the process of replacing missing data with substituted values.
  * We'll need to convert categorical features to dummy variables using pandas! Otherwise our machine learning algorithm won't be able to directly take in those features as inputs
  * pd.get_dummies() - To convert the categorical features to dummy variables. (drop_first=True)
  * Multi-collinearity: Bad for ML algorithms when a bunch of columns are perfect predictors for another column.
  * Steps:
    * Cleaning of the data which involves imputation and replacing categorical features with dummy variables
    * Selecting the features(columns) you want to train on
    * Splitting the data into test and train
    * Fitting the model
    * Obtaining predictions
    * Comparing predictions and actual desired outputs by generating collection_report
