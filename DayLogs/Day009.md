1. KNN algorithm
  * Pros 
    * Very simple
    * Training is trivial
    * Works with any number of classes
    * Easy to add more data
    * Few parameters
      * K
      * Distance Metric

  * Cons
    * High prediction cost
    * Not good with high dimensional data
    * Categorical features don't work well

  * Steps
    1. Select the columns of the dataset you want to work on
    2. Scale all the values to a Standard Scale
    3. Once the data is ready, perform the train test split
    4. Set the k value for KNN using elbow method
      * Calculate error rate for multiple k values and compare the results and then pick an appropriate k value
      * Check confusion_matrix and classification_report
    5. Train the model using training data and appropriate k value
    6. Use test data to make predictions
