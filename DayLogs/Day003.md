DataFrames
1. Groupby  
  You can use the .groupby() method to group rows together based off of a column name. Groupby will create a DataFrameGroupBy object. You can then call aggregate methods on this object.
    * mean()
    * std()
    * min()
    * max()
    * count()
    * describe() -- shows values for all aggregrate methods

2. Merging, joining and concatenating
    * Concatenation  
    Concatenation basically glues together DataFrames. Keep in mind that dimensions should match along the axis you are concatenating on. You can use **pd.concat** and pass in a list of DataFrames to concatenate together.

    * Merge  
    The merge function allows you to merge DataFrames together using a similar logic as merging SQL Tables together.

    * Join  
    Joining is a convenient method for combining the columns of two potentially differently-indexed DataFrames into a single result DataFrame.

3. Operations
    * unique()
    * nqunique()
    * value_counts()
    * Selecting data
    * Applying functions
    * Permanently removing a column  
    ```del df['W']```
    * sort_values()
    * isnull()
    * dropna()
    * pivot_table()

4. Data Input and Output
    * read_csv
    * read_excel
    * to_excel
